**KEY FEATURES**

+ Navigate your boat to discover the best scavenging spots.
+ Manage your oxygen levels and cable length, or face a horrible death in the depths.
+ Keep track of time: as the day passes the depths become darker and harder to navigate.
+ Return the scrap you find to the boat and sell it to cover your expenses.


P.S.
It was a hard challenge for us, the game is pretty raw and ~half of features were cut, but it is at it is.

We hope you enjoy  it!
